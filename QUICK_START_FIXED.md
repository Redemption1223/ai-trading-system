# 🚀 Quick Start - Fixed MT5 Connection

Your MT5 diagnostics show connection works, but the main system fails. Here's the fix:

## ✅ **Step 1: Test Fixed Connector**

```bash
# Test the basic fixed connector
python mt5_connector_fixed.py

# If that works, test the comprehensive version
python start_simple.py
```

## ✅ **Step 2: Monitor System Health**

```bash
# Run the system monitor for real-time diagnostics
python system_monitor.py
```

This will show you:
- Real-time MT5 connection status
- Live price feeds every 10 seconds
- Connection reliability statistics
- Automatic reconnection attempts

## ✅ **Step 3: Start Full Trading System**

Once the monitor shows stable connection:

```bash
# Start the full AGI trading system (now using fixed connector)
python start_trading_system.py
```

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

The original MT5 connector had these issues:
- ❌ Aggressive retry logic causing conflicts
- ❌ Complex threading that interfered with MT5
- ❌ Multiple initialization attempts causing instability

The fixed connector:
- ✅ Single, clean initialization
- ✅ Proper connection state management
- ✅ Simple, reliable approach
- ✅ Better error reporting

## 🎮 **System Monitor Commands**

When running `system_monitor.py`, you can use:
- **`status`** - Show MT5 connection and account info
- **`prices`** - Show current prices for major pairs
- **`stats`** - Show connection reliability statistics
- **`quit`** - Exit monitor

## 📊 **What You'll See**
