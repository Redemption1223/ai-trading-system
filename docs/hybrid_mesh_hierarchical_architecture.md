Action: All trading stops until recovery
Recovery: Automatic restart with saved state
```

#### SignalCoordinator (AGENT_02) Failure

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Load Balancing
1. **Dynamic Task Distribution**: SignalCoordinator monitors agent load
2. **Intelligent Routing**: Route requests to least busy mesh cluster agents
3. **Resource Pooling**: Share computational resources within mesh clusters

### Latency Optimization
1. **Message Prioritization**: Risk messages get highest priority
2. **Local Caching**: Mesh agents cache frequently accessed data
3. **Predictive Loading**: Pre-load data based on market patterns

### Scalability Patterns
1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more agents to mesh clusters
2. **Vertical Scaling**: Upgrade individual agent capabilities
3. **Elastic Scaling**: Dynamic agent spawning based on market volatility

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Tier 1 Agents**: Full system access with audit logging
- **Tier 2 Agents**: Market data access with transaction logging
- **Tier 3 Agents**: Data processing access with performance monitoring
- **Tier 4 Agents**: Read-only access with user interaction logging

### Message Security
- **Encryption**: All inter-agent messages encrypted
- **Authentication**: Agent identity verification required
- **Integrity**: Message tampering detection
- **Non-repudiation**: All risk decisions permanently logged

## Monitoring and Observability

### Agent Health Monitoring
```
SystemMonitor → Health Checks → All Agents (60s intervals)
              → Performance Metrics → Dashboard Updates
              → Alert Generation → Critical Threshold Breaches
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: Message round-trip times
- **Throughput**: Messages processed per second
- **Availability**: Agent uptime percentage
- **Accuracy**: Signal prediction success rate

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Hierarchical Risk Management
**Decision**: Place RiskCalculator at top of hierarchy with veto power
**Rationale**: Risk management must override all other decisions
**Consequences**: Increased latency for risk validation, enhanced safety

### ADR-002: Mesh Clustering by Function
**Decision**: Group related agents in mesh networks
**Rationale**: Reduce cross-network communication overhead
**Consequences**: Faster intra-cluster communication, potential isolation risks

### ADR-003: Single MT5 Connector
**Decision**: Isolate market interface to single agent
**Rationale**: Prevent conflicting trades and ensure transaction integrity
**Consequences**: Single point of failure, simplified debugging

### ADR-004: Centralized Signal Coordination
**Decision**: SignalCoordinator as master orchestrator
**Rationale**: Ensure consistent system state and coordination
**Consequences**: Potential bottleneck, simplified conflict resolution
